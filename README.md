# Thread Ops for Java

Thread Ops for Java is an open source toolkit providing multithreading tools supporting the implementation
of samethreaded, asynchronous, non-blocking IO systems.

Thread Ops makes it easier to execute a task in a one-off thread, or to call a "function" repeatedly inside a loop in
its own thread, and several other thread related tasks.
